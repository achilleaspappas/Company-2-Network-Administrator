# Backup Scripts

This project automates various backup and maintenance tasks, including:
- Copying databases from the cloud to network storage.
- Backing up user files.
- Cleaning up folders.
- Performing regular backups of network devices.

All tasks are scheduled via a cron job, which runs every minute. The `main.sh` script handles scheduling within specific time windows.

## Prerequisites
  - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
  - SMB/CIFS share access on your network for storing backup files
  - Logging paths correctly set up according to your environment

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
  ```
 git clone https://github.com/achilleaspappas/Company-2-Network-Administrator.git
  ```
2. Setup cron job.

## How It Works
### main.sh
* **Location**: /home/administrator/Documents/Scripts/main.sh
* **Purpose**: Schedules and executes different backup operations based on the time of day and date. It calls separate scripts to handle specific operations.
* **Parameters**: None; it schedules tasks based on the system clock.
* **Scheduling**: This script is executed every minute using the following cron job ``` * * * * * /home/administrator/Documents/Scripts/main.sh ```
* **Tasks**:
  * Database Backup: Calls systemBackupDatabases.sh with flags (trn, day, night) to back up various databases.
  * User File Backup: Runs systemBackupFiles.sh to sync user files between two NAS systems.
  * Folder Cleanup: Invokes systemEmptyFolders.sh to clear recycle bin files.
  * Network Device Backup: Executes networkBackup.sh to back up FortiGate and Cisco device configurations.
* **Logging**: Logs is not happening in this step.

### systemBackupDatabases.sh
* **Location**: /home/administrator/Documents/Scripts/systemBackupDatabases.sh
* **Purpose**: Handles copying databases from cloud storage to the designated NAS backup directory. It’s called with flags (trn, day, night) to specify which databases to back up.
* **Parameters**:
  * ```$1``` - flag: Indicates the type of backup to perform (day, night, or trn), which determines which specific folders will be backed up.
  * ```$src```: Source directory path for each backup task, set within the script for various folders.
  * ```$dst```: Destination directory path for each backup task, set within the script for various folders.
  * ```$name```: A label for the backup task, used for logging.
  * ```$log```: Path to the log file for recording the backup operation details.
  * ```$fileExtention```: The file extension of backup files to find and copy (e.g., bak or trn).
  * ```$timeCopy```: Modification time filter for files to copy (e.g., -1 for files modified within the last day).
  * ```$timeDelete```: Modification time filter for files to delete from the destination (e.g., +2 to delete files older than 2 days).
* **Scheduling**: Invoked by main.sh at specific times based on the backup type, ensuring backups occur regularly throughout the day.
* **Tasks**:
  * Validates the existence of source and destination directories for each backup operation.
  * Copies new or modified files from the source to the destination directory based on the specified flag.
  * Deletes outdated backup files from the destination directory as needed.
  * Logs each backup operation’s status (Success, Failed, or Warning) and records details of the outcome.
* **Logging**: Logs each backup operation with start and end times, backup type, and result status.

### systemBackupFiles.sh
* **Location**: /home/administrator/Documents/Scripts/systemBackupFiles.sh
* **Purpose**: This script synchronizes specified directories from a NAS to a backup NAS location, ensuring that files are copied and updated while also removing obsolete files.
* **Parameters**:
  * ```$1``` - src: Source directory path.
  * ```$2``` - dst: Destination directory path.
  * ```$3``` - name: The name associated with each user for logging purposes.
  * ```$4``` - log: Path for the log file where the script records operation details.
* **Scheduling**: Executed by main.sh as part of the scheduled job to perform user filed synchronization at specified intervals.
* **Tasks**:
  * Defines source and destination directories for each user.
  * Checks if source and destination directories exist before attempting synchronization.
  * Uses rsync for synchronazation.
  * Writes each operation’s start and end time, user name, and status (Success or Failure) to a log file for tracking and troubleshooting.
* **Logging**: Logs each sync operation with start and end timestamps, user name, status, and a description indicating success or the reason for failure.

### systemEmptyFolders.sh
* **Location**: /home/administrator/Documents/Scripts/systemEmptyFolders.sh
* **Purpose**: Periodically cleans up specified directories by deleting all files within them.
* **Parameters**: none
* **Scheduling**: Executed by main.sh as part of the scheduled job to perform cleanup at specified intervals.
* **Tasks**:
  * Defines target directories for cleanup and iterates through each directory.
  * Deletes all files within each specified directory using rm -rf.
  * Logs the start and end times of each cleanup operation to provide a timestamped record of when each directory was cleared.
* **Logging**: Logs each cleanup operation with start and end times, along with the description of the directory being cleared.

### networkBackup.sh
* **Location**: /home/administrator/Documents/Scripts/systemBackupDatabases.sh
* **Purpose**:  This shell script initiates the backup process for Fortinet and Cisco network devices by executing the respective Python scripts. It verifies destination paths, manages logging, and removes outdated files as part of the backup maintenance routine.
* **Parameters**:
  * ```$src```: Path to the Python script to execute for the backup (e.g., networkBackupFortinet.py or networkBackupCisco.py).
  * ```$dst```: Destination directory path where backup files will be saved.
